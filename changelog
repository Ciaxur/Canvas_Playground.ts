=== Version 1.1.0 ===

- Required the GL_Matrix npm Library
- Added WebGL Support
- Added WebGL Library
    - Added WebGL Shapes Module
    - Added Buffer Class Library
    - Added Colors Class Library
    - Added Scene Class Library
    - Added Shapes Library
    - Added Main WebGL Class Library
    - Added Interfaces
    - Added Textures
- Added Array Library
- Renamed the "Objects" Modules
- Added Simple Trig Formulas
- Updated Vectors Library
    - Added Vector3D Class
    - Added createVector2D
    - Added createVector3D
    - Adjusted createVector to recognize 2D or 3D
- Added a "Resources" & "Shaders" Directory that ONLY copies when Webpack compiles
    - All files in the DIR should NOT be in sub-directories (Flattens the Files when copying)
- Removed "Preload.ts"
- Added a new way to Preload in "app.ts"
- Added "Lighting.ts"
- Added VS Code Workspace Config File
- Added Directory ".config"
    - Added tslint Config File
- Refactored WebGL Directory to have neater Sub-Directories
    - Core (Core WebGL Library)
    - Examples (Example for the Library)
    - Global (Global Data throughout the WebGL Library)
    - Material (WebGL Material Data such as Lighting, Texture, Color, etc...)
    - Memory (Memory Management Data such as Buffers)
    - Debug (Debugging Methods)
    - Object (WebGL Objects such as Shapes)
- Added New Shape Generations
- Split up WebGL Scene into two main Methods (render and bindBuffers)
- Refactored WebGL.ts to have all the other Classes such as Examples, Materials, Objects, etc...
    - This way it's a single Library Class for all others combined
- Added Lighting.ts (Class) that handles how the Shader Program renders the Lighting
- Added an Algorithm.ts Module to Generate/Calculate Manipulations and Structures based on Math
    - Connects two Verticies (Shapes) together



TO-DO: 
    - Update the README.md, specifically add how the 'src' directory is Structured and what they do :)
    - Refactor bindBuffer to have the Texture and the rest of the info in Buffer in order to BIND it before it draws it
    - Adapt the "linkVertices" method in Algorithm.ts to be able to adapt to different vertex length from vert1 or vert2
        - Concept: 
            - If Vert1 has more points than vert2, divide the number of points from vert1 to adapt to vert2 connecting ALL points
                from vert1 to all points from vert2.
            - If vert2 has more points than vert1 same thing, connect ALL points from vert2 to all points from vert1


Later Work:
    - Refactor the Cirlce's Depth (Cylinder Algorithm) under GenerateShapes -> createCircle

Bugs:
    - Issue when creating a Circle with NO depth, the shape is not flat but tilted
