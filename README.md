# Canvas_Playground.ts
**Simple Canvas API playground written in Typescript.**
--
This project is simply me learning the ins and outs of the **`Canvas API`** but I will be updating this repository as I learn more. Anyone is welcome to use this and contribute :).

# How Install
In this project, I used Yarn for all the package dependencies. The first step is to install all the required packages (I am not going into how to use `yarn` or `powershell`).


Install Packages using `Yarn`
``` powershell
# Make sure current working directory is corrent
# Run the Yarn Package Manager to install packages
yarn
```

Code away in the **`app.ts`** file making sure to import any modules from other directories in the Library.

# How to Build

Once finished coding, build the Library using **`npm`**.
``` powershell
# To Fully build the Program simply run this
npm run build

# To Watch the Program for changes and auto-build it run this
npm run watch
```

To lauch the Built application, simply launch a local server. I use python to do so.
``` powershell
# Run a local server in the 'dist' directory
python -m http.server
```


# Contribution

Contributing is very simple, don't move directories around, but feel free to add new Directories but **KEEP IT NEAT**. Add or fix functionallity to the library and submit a Pull Request :)
